Journal of Economic Literature Pointers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Do not use an ``Introduction" heading. Begin your introductory material  before the first section heading.
          
    \item Avoid style markup (except sparingly for emphasis).
          
    \item Avoid using explicit vertical or horizontal space.
          
    \item Captions are short and go below figures but above tables.
          
    \item The tablenotes or figurenotes environments may be used below tables
          or figures, respectively, as demonstrated below.
          
    \item If you have difficulties with the mathtime package, adjust the package
          options appropriately for your platform. If you can't get it to work, just
          remove the package or see our technical support document online (please
          refer to the author instructions).
          
    \item If you are using an appendix, it goes last, after the bibliography.
          Use regular section headings to make the appendix headings.
          
    \item If you are not using an appendix, you may delete the appendix command
          and sample appendix section heading.
          
    \item Either the natbib package or the harvard package may be used with bibtex.
          To include one of these packages, uncomment the appropriate usepackage command
          above. Note: you can't use both packages at once or compile-time errors will result.
          
\end{itemize}

\section{First Section in Body}

Sample figure:

\begin{figure}
    Figure here.
    
    \caption{Caption for figure below.}
    \begin{figurenotes}
        Figure notes without optional leadin.
    \end{figurenotes}
    \begin{figurenotes}[Source]
        Figure notes with optional leadin (Source, in this case).
    \end{figurenotes}
\end{figure}

Sample table:

\begin{table}
    \caption{Caption for table above.}
    
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
              & Heading 1 & Heading 2 \\ 
        Row 1 & 1         & 2         \\ 
        Row 2 & 3         & 4         %
    \end{tabular}
    \begin{tablenotes}
        Table notes environment without optional leadin.
    \end{tablenotes}
    \begin{tablenotes}[Source]
        Table notes environment with optional leadin (Source, in this case).
    \end{tablenotes}

References here (manual or bibTeX). If you are using bibTeX, add your bib file 
name in place of BibFile in the bibliography command. Here is a citation: \cite{Lehe2024}.
% Remove or comment out the next two lines if you are not using bibtex.
\bibliographystyle{aea}
\bibliography{BibFile}

% The appendix command is issued once, prior to all appendices, if any.
